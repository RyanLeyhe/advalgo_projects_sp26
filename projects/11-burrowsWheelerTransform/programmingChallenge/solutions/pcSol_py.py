# Compute the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) of a string.
# 
# BWT in 3 steps:
# 1. List every cyclic rotation of the string.
#    Example:
#       s = "banana$"
#
#       rotations = [
#           "banana$",
#           "anana$b",
#           "nana$ba",
#           "ana$ban",
#           "na$bana",
#           "a$banan",
#           "$banana"            
#       ]
#
# 2. Sort cyclic rotations into lexicographic order.
#    Example:    
#       rotations = [
#           "$banana",
#           "a$banan",
#           "ana$ban",
#           "anana$b",
#           "banana$",
#           "na$bana",
#           "nana$ba"        
#       ]
#
# 3. Form a new string by taking the last character from each sorted rotation.
#    Example:
#       last_column = "annb$aa"
#
#    The resulting string is the Burrows-Wheeler Transform
#
# This solution uses the naive version of BWT because it is the easiest to follow
# for students learning the algorithm. Optimized approaches exist and were
# discussed in our presentation. 
def bwt(s):
    # Allocate an array to keep track of all cyclic rotations of the 
    # input string. 
    rotations = []

    # Generate each cyclic rotation of s by first choosing start position i.
    # s[i:] takes everything from i to the end.
    # s[:i] takes everything from the beginning to i.
    # Concatenating the two creates one cyclic rotation starting at i.
    for i in range(len(s)):
        rotation = s[i:] + s[:i]
        rotations.append(rotation)

    # Sort the rotations lexicographically using the problem's custom order.
    # $ < " " < a < b < c < ... < z
    rotations.sort(key=lambda row: [CHAR_TO_INDEX[ch] for ch in row])

    # After sorting, the BWT is formed by taking the last character from
    # each row of the rotation table. 
    last_column = []
    for rotation in rotations:
        last_column.append(rotation[-1])

    # Join the collected characters into one string and return the BWT.
    return "".join(last_column)


# Invert a Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) string.
#
# Inverse BWT in 3 steps:
# 1. Start with an empty table with one row for each character in the BWT.
#    Example:
#       bwt = "annb$aa"
#       
#       table = [
#           "",
#           "",
#           "",
#           "",
#           "",
#           "",
#           ""
#       ]
#
# 2. Rebuild the sorted rotation table.
#    Each iteration:
#       - prepends the i'th BWT character to the i'th row
#       - sorts the rows lexicographically
#    Example:
#       After iteration 1:
#           table = [
#               "$",
#               "a",
#               "a",
#               "a",
#               "b",
#               "n",
#               "n"
#           ]
#
#       After iteration 2:
#           table = [
#               "$b",
#               "a$",
#               "an",
#               "an",
#               "ba",
#               "na",
#               "na",
#           ]
#
#       ...
#
#       After all n iterations:
#           table = [
#               "$banana",
#               "a$banan",
#               "ana$ban",
#               "anana$b",
#               "banana$",
#               "na$bana",
#               "nana$ba",
#           ]
#
# 3. Extract the row that ends with $. This is the original string.
#    Example:
#       original_string = "banana"
# 
# This solution uses the naive version of inverse BWT because it is the easiest
# to follow for students learning the algorithm. Optimized approaches exist and 
# were discussed in our presentation.

    # original string.

        # After adding the new column, sort again using the problem's
        # custom order, so that the rows stay in the same lexicographic 
        # order they would have in the full rotation table.

    # Each iteration tests one possible BWT.

        complete_bwt = apply_replacement_character(corrupted_bwt, ch)

        # Attempt to decode the BWT back into its original message.
        decoded_message = inverse_bwt(complete_bwt)

        # Inverse BWT gives us a candidate original string, but we have
        # to verify that it is actually consistent with this complete BWT.
        # To do that:
        #   - append $ back to the decoded message.
        #   - run BWT and check if we get the same string. 
        if bwt(decoded_message + "$") != complete_bwt:
            # If the BWT does not match, then ch did not produce a valid transmission.
            continue

        # In this case, the replacement is valid.
        # So, keep the smallest decoded message as per the problem statement.
